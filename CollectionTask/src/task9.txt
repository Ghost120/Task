A white birch, in the morning
In the window pane,
Is enwrapped in snow like
In a silver veil.

Tassels, outstretching,
Deck the downy boughs,
Trimming snowy edgings
With white fringy downs.

And the birch is standing
In her drowsy quiet,
Snowflakes burning, flashing
In the golden fire,

While the daybreak, making
Lazily its beat,
Keeps on strewing freshly
Silver on the twigs.
